- Decide is AI is the right approcahc for your problem
    - if the problem can be solved with a well defined set of rules -> not AI
    - plenty of data with useful information about your problem -> AI
- Collect and prepare your data
    - cleanup, format, eliminate rows or fields
    - choose features that you will use as input for predictions (suh as medical history) 
    - choose what you will predict - probability for a disease
    - split into training data and test data, say 80% to 20%
- Train your model
    - chose algorithms or use them all.
- Evaluate your model
- Tuning the model's hyperparameters
- Testing the trained model in the real-world
